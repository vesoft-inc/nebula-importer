Official Nebula Go client which communicates with the server using [fbthrift](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift/).

  

Please be careful do not to modify the files in the graph directory, these codes were all generated by fbthrift.

  

## Install

  

```shell

$ go get -u -v github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-clients/go@master

```

  

If you get a message like `cannot use path@version syntax in GOPATH mode`, see the instructions below for [enabling go modules](#enabling-go-modules).

  

## Usage example

  

[Code Example](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-clients/tree/master/go/example/graph_client_example.go)

  

## Enabling go modules

  

Dependency management tools are built into go 1.11+ in the form of [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).

If you are using go 1.11 or 1.12 and are working with a project located within `$GOPATH`, you need to do:

  

```sh

export GO111MODULE=on

```

  

Ensure your project has a `go.mod` file defined at the root of your project.

If you do not already have one, `go mod init` will create one for you:

  

```sh

go mod init

```

  

And then try to get dependencies of `github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-clients/go` in your go module by simply `go get -u -v github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-clients/go@master`.
